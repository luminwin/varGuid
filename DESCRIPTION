Description: Advanced regression techniques to address heteroscedasticity in linear models. It features two key algorithms: an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) method for robust coefficient estimation under linear variance patterns, and a biconvex algorithm that creates artificial grouping effects to capture nonlinear relationships.
